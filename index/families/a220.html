      <h2>The A220 Family - Purpose built for efficiency</h2>
      <h5>Airbus’ global reach and scale includes the A220 Family, which is now being produced in the Airbus Canada Limited Partnership – held 75% by Airbus and 25% by the Government of Québec. These aircraft expand the Airbus single-aisle family to cover the 100-150 seat segment – and respond to a worldwide market demand for smaller single-aisle jetliners.</h5>

	  <button class="accordion">A220-100</button>
<div class="panel">
<h2>Built-in efficiency</h2>
<p>The smallest jetliner in Airbus’ in-production product line, the A220-100, was built from the ground up to serve the 100-135 seat market with unbeatable efficiency and comfort. With broad seats, plenty of overhead storage space and large windows, it’s a single-aisle aircraft that feels like a wide-body jet.
<br>
<br>
The extensive use of advanced materials such as composites in the wings, empennage and rear fuselage – reduces weight and increases corrosion resistance, resulting in better efficiency and maintainability. These modern materials make up more than 40% of the aircraft’s primary structure, delivering weight savings for reduced fuel burn, with an accompanying reduction of CO2 and NOx emissions.
<br>
<br>
Powered by Pratt & Whitney PurePower PW1500G geared turbofan engines specifically designed for the family, the A220-100 can connect distant airports with its 3,450 nm range and best-in-class airfield performance. The A220 Family is ideal for hot-and-high and city-centre airport operations. In fact, the A220-100 is the largest aircraft able to operate in the constrained environment of London City Airport. From such challenging airports, the A220 Family’s performance and efficiency give it a built-in advantage.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Passenger comfort</h2>
<p>In addition to delivering best-in-class economics, the A220 Family’s cabin was purpose-built to deliver an exceptional passenger experience. A220 Family aircraft are recognised for their low noise levels, providing a quiet and comfortable cabin.
<br>
<br>
Wide seats combined with ample overhead storage create personal space without compromising on headroom, and the cabin management system provides crews with easy, intuitive control of the aircraft’s interior environment, including entertainment offerings and mood lighting.
<br>
<br>
Like the larger A220-300 version, the A220-100’s configurable cabin provides two flex zones, allowing operators to benefit from fully customisable modular cabin elements, including stowage areas and partitions, based on their specific needs.

<h2>Lean, economical and efficient</h2>
<p>The larger member of the A220 Family – the A220-300 – was specifically designed and purpose-built for the 120-160 seat market. It represents the fusion of performance and technology, allowing airlines to connect distant points on continents or sectors that were previously unprofitable or impossible.
<br>
<br>
The A220-300’s advanced aerodynamics combined with specifically-designed Pratt & Whitney PurePower PW1500G geared turbofan engines contribute to an aircraft that delivers 25% lower fuel burn per seat than previous generation aircraft, half the noise footprint, and decreased emissions, making it a true community-minded jetliner.
<br>
<br>
Both members of the A220 Family share commonality in more than 99% of the line-replaceable units (LRUs), as well as the same family of engines – meaning operators can fly both versions and at a significant cost savings. Flight crews with the same pilot type rating, as well as cabin personnel, will enjoy a seamless transition between the A220-300 and A220-100, greatly reducing complexity and training costs.

      <h2>High efficiency, low risk</h2>
      <p>A220 Family aircraft have been specifically designed for the 100-150 seat market, resulting in efficiencies inherent in purpose-built aircraft, and an unmatched environmental scorecard. What’s more, the A220-100 and A220-300 have over 99% parts commonality, as well as the same pilot type rating, facilitating the family’s addition to any airline’s fleet.
	  <br>
	  A220 Family jetliners were designed using state-of-the-art computational aerodynamics combined with 21st century supercomputing capability; the result is a family of aircraft with optimal aerodynamic performance and efficiency. Powering the aircraft are twin Pratt & Whitney PurePower PW1500G geared turbofan engines specifically designed for the A220. With a bypass ratio of 12:1 – one of the highest of any turbofan engine in the world – the aircraft features 25% lower fuel burn per seat than previous generation aircraft, half the noise footprint, and decreased emissions.
	  <br>
	  Together, the A220 Family represents the most efficient aircraft in the skies in their class, with low operating costs and low noise levels. This makes the A220 Family aircraft ideal for urban operations and noise-sensitive airports.
	  </p>
	  <h2>Superior single-aisle comfort</h2>
      <p>A220 Family aircraft are designed to deliver the feel of a wide-body jetliner in a single-aisle aircraft. The cabin provides space where it matters the most, leading to an unparalleled passenger experience.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  Overhead bins, with the largest stowage capacity in their class, are easily accessible. The extra-large windows with more than one at each row, are positioned high on the cabin sidewall to provide an optimal viewing angle and an abundance of natural light. Wide seats –18 inches or more – provide a generous personal space without compromise, and the newly designed engines contribute to the quietest cabin in its class.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  The A220 lower deck cargo hold boasts a wide flat floor and vertical sidewalls for efficient stacking, which result in a significantly higher usable volume than the competition.
