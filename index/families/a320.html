      <h2>A320 Family - Unbeatable fuel efficiency</h2>
      <p>The A320 is one aircraft in four sizes (A318, A319, A320 and A321), representing the most successful and versatile jetliner family ever. Seating from 100 to 240 passengers and flying throughout the world, with the widest single-aisle cabin, an A320 takes off or lands every 1.6 seconds. From the heat of the desert to icy Antarctic runways, or from short runway urban environments to remote high-altitude airports, the A320 can take passengers anywhere.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  As the longest-range single-aisle aircraft, airlines and passengers alike have benefitted from the A320’s exceptional efficiency and quality since its introduction, which has opened up exciting new travel possibilities throughout the world. Now with new engine options (NEO) available, the A320 Family continues to be the preferred choice for passengers and customers; setting the standard for the single-aisle market and securing its status as the world’s best-selling aircraft of all time.This is an aircraft that you can rely on. This is the aircraft that changed the game.</p>
      <div>

	  <button class="accordion">A318</button>
<div class="panel">
<h5>Typically seating between 90 and 110 passengers, the A318 brings all the advantages of the A320 Family to a variety of possible routes suitable for a slightly smaller aircraft. With one aircraft in four sizes the A318 offers unbeatable fuel-efficiency, exceptional operational reliability and superior passenger comfort – qualities which help make the A320 Family the most successful aircraft family ever. Its enduring quality highlights the brilliance and innovation at the heart of Airbus.</h5>
<h2>“Steep approach” capability</h2>
<p>
Airbus' A318 is certified to land at steeper-than-usual gradients, with the potential to transform long-haul operations between city centres, as well as reduce time and costs for business travellers. The A318 was approved for steep approach landing capability by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in 2007, with this modern jetliner certified for a 5.5-degree approach slope. This compares to a nominal 3-degree slope for standard operations.
</p>
<h2>Comfort and space</h2>
<p>
The A320 leads the way in single-aisle comfort and even as the family member with the shortest fuselage, the A318 still offers the industry’s best level of comfort in all classes.
<br>
<br>
With the widest single-aisle cabin available, passengers can enjoy more personal space and relax in comfortable 18-inch-wide seats. The A320 also has plenty of overhead locker space so that carry-on luggage can be stored efficiently, while the wider aisle helps with boarding and disembarking. These advantages allow for minimum fuss when getting on or off, meaning less wait time at the end of a flight so that passengers can get to where they’re going more quickly.</p>

<h2>Commonality where it counts</h2>
<p>
When something works brilliantly, it makes sense to use it all the time. Like all the members of the aircraft family that introduced Airbus’ revolutionary fly-by-wire control system, the A318 benefits from cockpit commonality, helping to reduce the cost of training, maintenance and operation of the aircraft.
<br>
<br>
Not only are pilots qualified to fly any member of the A320 Family with the Common Type Rating, but training to switch between other Airbus aircraft is even easier with Cross Crew-Qualification (CCQ). Fly-by-wire offers significant advantages from the savings delivered through the reduction in weight to the reduction in pilot workload; another example of how Airbus improves performance through innovation.
</p>
<h2>Unique capabilities</h2>
<p>
The A318’s cabin is flexible enough to deliver a range of options, allowing it to fulfil several roles. As the largest commercial aircraft certified to land at steeper-than-usual gradients, it is ideal for operations at such constrained locations as downtown airports – translating to significant cost and time savings for business travellers. Since 2009, British Airways has been operating A318s with “steep approach” capability from the in-close London City Airport to New York's JFK International Airport.
<br>
<br>
These aircraft are equipped for premium service with seats that convert into full lie-flat beds, along with OnAir connectivity for passengers showing that even the smallest member of the A320 Family needn’t compromise on luxury and amenities.

<h2>New Engine Option</h2>
<p>
The industry-leading quality and efficiency of Airbus’ A320 Family – of which the A321 is a member – is being further enhanced with its new engine option (NEO) jetliner versions. Incorporating Airbus’ “Sharklets” and two new engine choices, the A320neo Family offers maximum benefit with minimal changes from baseline A319s, A320s and A321s – delivering per seat fuel improvements of 20%, along with additional range of up to 500 nautical miles/900 km. or 2 tonnes of extra payload.  
<br>
<br>
For the A321neo – delivered to a customer for the first time in April 2017 – Airbus expanded seating capacity with optimised use of cabin space, increased exit limits and a new cabin door configuration. This “Cabin-Flex” option increased the jetliner’s maximum certified capacity to 244 seats, while still accommodating Airbus’ modern comfort standard of at least 18-inch wide seats.  
<br>
<br>
The A321LR variant provides extended range for the A320neo Family’s longest fuselage version, able to fly routes of up to 4,000 nm with 206 passengers by utilising extra fuel in three Additional Centre Tanks (ACTs).
<br>
<br>
Ideally suited to transatlantic routes, the A321LR allows airlines to tap into new long-haul markets that were not previously accessible with current single-aisle aircraft. Operators can outfit its cabin in state-of-the-art two-class configurations – including full-flat seats for true long-haul comfort – or in a single-class layout. The A321neo offers true long-haul comfort, featuring full-flat seats, low interior noise and latest IFE.
<br>
<br>
The A321LR’s long-range capability was certified by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in October 2018. The first A321LR was delivered to launch customer Arkia Israeli Airlines in November 2018.</p>

<h2>A321XLR: Efficiency and extra-long range</h2>

The A321XLR is extending the single-aisle jetliner offer as Airbus’ next evolutionary step for the A321neo Family, with a service entry planned in 2023. It will offer even more range – up to 4,700 nm (8,700 km) – in a comfortable 2-class layout, thanks to an increased maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of 101 tonnes, which enables the jetliner to be fitted with a permanent Rear Centre Tank (carrying 12,900 litres of fuel) and an optional forward Additional Centre Tank.
<br>
<br>
Aerodynamic-enhancing Sharklets on the wings and fuel-efficient engines ensure outstanding environmental performance: 20% lower fuel burn per seat, 5,000 tonnes less CO2 per year, and a noise footprint that is 50% lower for passengers and airports.
<br>
<br>
Configured with true long-haul full flat seats – or up to 244 passengers in single class layouts – the A321XLR cabin will benefit from the Airspace interior, featuring a range of cabin elements providing both tangible benefits for passengers and differentiation for airlines. With the A321XLR, the A320neo Family not only will share common cockpit ergonomics with the Airbus wide-body jetliners, but also will have a common cabin design language and the latest technology.
<br>
<br>
Among the new interior’s enhanced elements are the largest overhead storage compartment (called “XL bins”) with 40% more volume, as well as iconic ceiling lighting, new sidewall panels, a new lavatory design, new window bezels, and coloured LED lighting for the cabin.
<br>
<br>
With single-aisle flight times growing longer with the A320neo’s increased range, Airbus prioritises in-flight wireless connectivity to enhance the passenger experience, while also keeping cabin personnel and flight crews informed of the on-board status.
